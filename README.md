# Clustering Customer Segments by Demographics

## Purpose

This is my unsupervised learning project for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. This project focuses on taking general demographic data about the population of Germany (provided at an individual person level) and performing clustering on it to segment the population into similar groups. This will allow us to train a model that then can be applied to data about customers in a mail-order sales company to segment that customer base and see in what demographic clusters customers may be overrepresented. This knowledge can then be applied to business decisions such as determining what groups of non-customers in the German population would be most receptive to direct advertising campaigns, for example.

## The Data

As mentioned in the earlier section, two datasets are utilized in this project: 

1. Individual German citizen demographics, derived from public datasets and stastical approximations. These data cover 891,221 individuals with 85 features.

2. Individual customer demographics (presumably *German* customers, although the project details are a bit unclear on this) for a mail-order sales company. These data cover 191,652 individuals with 85 features.

**Note:** these data are provided for this project under a restricted use license and thus cannot be provided publicly, but the code and results are included here as they are presumably sufficiently aggregated to make sharing not an issue.
