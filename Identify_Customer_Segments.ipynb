    "# Project: Identify Customer Segments\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will help you complete this task by providing a framework within which you will perform your analysis steps. In each step of the project, you will see some text describing the subtask that you will perform, followed by one or more code cells for you to complete your work. **Feel free to add additional code and markdown cells as you go along so that you can explore everything in precise chunks.** The code cells provided in the base template will outline only the major tasks, and will usually not be enough to cover all of the minor tasks that comprise it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that while there will be precise guidelines on how you should handle certain tasks in the project, there will also be places where an exact specification is not provided. **There will be times in the project where you will need to make and justify your own decisions on how to treat the data.** These are places where there may not be only one way to handle the data. In real-life tasks, there may be many valid ways to approach an analysis task. One of the most important things you can do is clearly document your approach so that other scientists can understand the decisions you've made.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of most sections, there will be a Markdown cell labeled **Discussion**. In these cells, you will report your findings for the completed section, as well as document the decisions that you made in your approach to each subtask. **Your project will be evaluated not just on the code used to complete the tasks outlined, but also your communication about your observations and conclusions at each stage.**"

You will use this information to cluster the general population into groups with similar demographic properties. Then, you will see how the people in the customers dataset fit into those created clusters. The hope here is that certain clusters are over-represented in the customers data, as compared to the general population; those over-represented clusters will be assumed to be part of the core userbase. This information can then be used for further applications, such as targeting for a marketing campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start off with, load in the demographics data for the general population into a pandas DataFrame, and do the same for the feature attributes summary. Note for all of the `.csv` data files in this project: they're semicolon (`;`) delimited, so you'll need an additional argument in your [`read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) call to read in the data properly. Also, considering the size of the main dataset, it may take some time for it to load completely.\n",

And since it would only apply to a small portion of the dataset (those considered \"elderly\") it seems like it isn't crucial in terms of providing information, especially since we have other features that provide us with age-related information anyhow.\n",

    "4. `KBA05_BAUMAX`: RR3: Most Common Bldg Type - mixed\n",
    "    * We can probably drop this one too, as it's more than 50% missing and is somewhat duplicative in information with the other `KBA05` features\n",
    "5. `GEBURTSJAHR`: Birth Year - numeric\n",
    "    * This is where it gets a bit tougher. I tend not to be too worried about dropping features with more than 50% missing values, but this one is only at 44%. As this is the specific birth year (at least as implied by the data dictionary), it is likely a better measure of the age of each individual in the dataset than even the `ALTERSKATEGORIE_GROB` feature, so we'll retain it\n",
    "    * I freely admit that I originally intended to drop this one, as it was well outside the majority of features in terms of the distribution of missing values by feature shown in the preceding visualization, but the instructions later in this project made me change my mind (since they indicate I shouldn't have dropped any numeric or interval features). Given that, [upon further research](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-handle-missing-data-8646b18db0d4) I found some guidance to retain a feature and impute its missing values when it has less than 50-60% missing, I was willing to be convinced that this feature should be retained.\n",
    "6. `ALTER_HH`: Head of Household birthdate (bin) - interval\n",
    "    * This one is a little less helpful than `GEBURTSJAHR` as it only provides the head of household's birth year in 5-year bins. So given that fact and that it's still significantly more missing values than the rest of the features with less than 200,000 missing values, I'm going to drop it."

    "\n",
    "Some notes on patterns I noticed during my exploration of the missing data as a function of column/feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Before matching codes for unknown/missing values and filling in those values with `np.nan`, we had 6.4% of all values reported as missing. Afterwards, 10.6% of all values were missing.\n",
    "2. I removed features with more than 50% missing values as they appeared to be outliers in terms of the amount of missing values relative to the overall feature set and for the reasons discussed above.\n",
    "3. In the data that are remaining, I see clear breakpoints between features with 0% - 2% missing values, those with 8% - 18% missing, and the two features with 35% and 44% missing values.\n",
    "    * **Those in the group with 0% - 2% missing:**\n",
    "        * There are 32 features included in this subset/sample\n",
    "        * Of those 32, all but two (`RR1: Online Affinity` and `HH: Net Income Bins`) are person-level measures (30, in other words). Given that ~50% of all features are person-level, this suggests that person-level features are overrepresented in the subset (if the information levels were distributed the same in this sample as they are in the total population, we'd expect only 16-17 features to be person-level). \n",
    "            * Also, this means that 70% of the total 43 possible person-level features in the full feature space are represented in this sample.\n",
    "        * Given that Head of Household birthdate and individual birth year both had very high missing data counts (causing them to be dropped as outliers), it's surprising to see `Age Bin` with such a relatively low number of missing values. That seems really odd, but likely it is due to the method used for determining the age of an individual. The `Age Bin` values cover 15-30 year chunks of a person's life, whereas the birth year and head of household birth date features had resolutions of 1 and 5 years, resp.\n",
    "        * It's also interesting to note that `Consumption Channel Type`, `Vacation Habits`, `Customer Type`, `Socioeconomic Status - HighRes`, `Socioeconomic Status - LowRes`, and `Online Affinity` all have the exact same number of missing values. This suggests to me that they all came from the same data source and likely used the same methodology for their derivation, as this pattern seems a little too consistent to be random.\n",
    "    * **Those in the group with 8% - 18% missing:**\n",
    "        * There are 47 features included in this sample/subset\n",
    "        * Of those 47, 10 (21%) are person-level features, suggesting that missing/unknown data are much more common at the higher-level resolutions than at the person-level. \n",
    "            * This strikes me as odd, given especially that many of those person-level feature values were likely not directly measured, but rather derived from higher-level datasets (e.g. statistically modeled from census data).\n",
    "        * It seems particularly odd that so many of the features that have higher missing value rates seem to be highly measurable quantities (e.g. from census/GIS data, such as the number of inhabitants in a community).\n",
    "    * **I already discussed my thoughts on those with 35% and 44% missing.**\n",
    "        * I retained the 44% missing birth year feature, as it seems to provide significant information useful for later analysis\n",
    "        * One other thought: these are age-related variables, one at the person-level and one at the household-level. It seems odd to me that the `Age Bin` feature should be in the lowest missing value count group and these in the highest. Even though they have significantly higher resolutions than the `Age Bin` feature, they must still be drawn from very different data sources, since they shouldn't be *so* different. Strange."

As with the columns, you should see some groups of points that have a very different numbers of missing values. Divide the data into two subsets: one for data points that are above some threshold for missing values, and a second subset for points below that threshold.\n",

    "In order to know what to do with the outlier rows, we should see if the distribution of data values on columns that are not missing data (or are missing very little data) are similar or different between the two groups. Select at least five of these columns and compare the distribution of values.\n",

On the other hand, if the data with many missing values looks very different from the data with few or no missing values, then we should make a note on those data as special.

    "1. `Life Stage - HighRes` and ` - LowRes`: lots of info, but inconsistent levels\n",
    "    * These have information related to age, marital status, income level, homeownership status, and (birth?) household type, making them potentially rich for new generating new features\n",
    "    * *However*, the levels are very inconsistent across the codes, making it impossible to pull out the same information across all original codes \n",
    "        * Even if we were willing to drop information like we did earlier for the `Generation Designation` feature (East vs. West, if you recall), we couldn't do that here since some values have a completely different set of levels than others do.\n",
    "    * As a result of all of this, I'm going to be treating these as though they're categorical, making dummies out of all of them\n",
    "2. `Bldg: Neighborhood Quality`: non-obvious ordering of values\n",
    "    * `Bldg: Neighborhood Quality` seems at first glance to be clearly ordinal, until you realize that \"rural\" and \"new building rural\" aren't inherently *less than* a \"very poor neighborhood\"\n",
    "    * The plan: we'll split this into a Rural categorical (dummy) feature and set any observations with the rural codes in the original feature to np.nan, so we can maintain the ordinal information as much as possible as well as the rural/urban split information, even though we won't have any quality information on the rural buildings (which we never had to begin with!)\n",
    "3. `PLZ8: Most Common Bldg Type`: mixed ordering\n",
    "    * If I'm interpreting this one correctly, it refers to the size of buildings (e.g. how many families can be housed within one). That would seem to me to be an indication of square footage, but since multi-family buildings are measured differently than businesses (e.g. a convenience store is much smaller than a 10-family home, but a grocery store is much larger), it's not appropriate to keep them on the same ordinal scale.\n",
    "    * That being said, the other `PLZ8` features essentially capture the scale of majority building type if it is a certain size of multi-family home. The only new information provided in this feature is if it is primarily business buildings, so we'll simply make it a binary feature indicating if business buildings are the primary property type or not."

    "\n",
    "1. `Generation Designation` (`PRAEGENDE_JUGENDJAHRE`) was split into a feature focused on the decade of that person's generation and the movement they were associated with from that decade (avantgarde or mainstream)\n",
    "2. For `RR4: Life Stage Type - Int'l Code Mapping` (`CAMEO_INTL_2015`), I split the feature into two new features that extracted information from the original feature about a person's wealth level and their current life stage.\n",
    "3. As they didn't seem to have any meaningful ordinal/interval/numeric data that I needed to salvage, I decided to treat `Life Stage - HighRes` and `Life Stage - LowRes` as categorical variables and made dummies from them\n",
    "4. With `Bldg: Neighborhood Quality`, I made the assumption based on the levels of this variable that likely any codes that didn't mention rural buildings reflected areas that were not primarily rural. As such, I extracted a new multi-level categorical feature that indicates if a person's building is primarily in a rural neighborhood, in a rural neighborhood but a new building, or not in a rural neighborhood at all. I then made dummies out of this new feature. I otherwise left the feature as it was, since the neighborhood quality score (presumably for non-rural neighborhoods only) is of interval type (or at least ordinal).\n",
    "5. For our final mixed-type feature, `PLZ8: Most Common Bldg Type`, I investigated the feature's allowed levels a bit and determined that it was mostly redundant with the other PLZ8 features we already have. That being said, I determined that it shouldn't be dropped as it contained information about how prominent business buildings are in the PLZ8 region, something I didn't see reflected in the other features. So I stripped that information out of the feature as a binary feature unto itself and dropped the rest of the information."

    "Before we apply dimensionality reduction techniques to the data, we need to perform feature scaling so that the principal component vectors are not influenced by the natural differences in scale for features. Starting from this part of the project, you'll want to keep an eye on the [API reference page for sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html) to help you navigate to all of the classes and functions that you'll need. In this substep, you'll need to check the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- sklearn requires that data not have missing values in order for its estimators to work properly. So, before applying the scaler to your data, make sure that you've cleaned the DataFrame of the remaining missing values. This can be as simple as just removing all data points with missing data, or applying an [Imputer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer.html) to replace all missing values. You might also try a more complicated procedure where you temporarily remove missing values in order to compute the scaling parameters before re-introducing those missing values and applying imputation. Think about how much missing data you have and what possible effects each approach might have on your analysis, and justify your decision in the discussion section below.\n",
    "- For the actual scaling function, a [StandardScaler](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html) instance is suggested, scaling each feature to mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n",
    "- For these classes, you can make use of the `.fit_transform()` method to both fit a procedure to the data as well as apply the transformation to the data at the same time. Don't forget to keep the fit sklearn objects handy, since you'll be applying them to the customer demographics data towards the end of the project."
